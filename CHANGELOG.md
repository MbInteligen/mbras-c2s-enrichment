## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

#### IBVI-401: Unified Context Endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/context` — unified context endpoint that fans out to Work API + Meilisearch + IBVI properties in parallel via `tokio::join!`
- Accepts `?cpf=`, `?phone=`, or `?email=` query parameters
- Auto-discovers CPF from phone/email via DB lookup with Diretrix fallback
- Returns combined JSON with `work_api`, `companies`, `properties`, and `sources` map
- Work API failure is non-fatal (returns partial result with `sources.work_api: false`)
- New file: `src/context.rs` (~120 LoC)
- Route added to `protected_routes` in `src/main.rs`

#### Cross-Frontend Support
- Endpoint consumed by both `next-ai-chat` (IBVI-390 getContext tool) and `crm-ai-chat` (IBVI-395 context command)
